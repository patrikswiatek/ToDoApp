# React Drive-In

![npm release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-drive-in.svg?style=flat)

A wicked awesome replacement for BigVideo.js that is lighter with fewer dependencies. It _does not_ use jQuery, video.js, or any other large libraries. Only 5k minified and gzipped. This React component is a wrapper over the core [Drive-In](https://github.com/ronik-design/drive-in) lib.

Demo and some example functionality here: [github.io](http://ronik-design.github.io/react-drive-in/)

Created by [Ronik Design](http://www.ronikdesign.com).

## Install

So easy. React is the only required peer dependency: [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html).

- Using NPM
```bash
  $ npm install --save-dev react-drive-in
```

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/releases/latest)

## Usage

- The easiest example
```javascript
  const React = require("react");
  const ReactDOM = require("react-dom");
  const ReactDriveIn = require("react-drive-in");

  ReactDOM.render(
    <ReactDriveIn
      show="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/master/example/glacier.mp4"
      poster="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/master/example/glacier.jpg"
    />,
    $mountNode
  );
```

- More complex
```javascript
  const React = require("react");
  const ReactDOM = require("react-dom");
  const ReactDriveIn = require("react-drive-in");

  const PLAYLIST = [
    [
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/pelo.mp4?raw=true",
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/pelo.ogv?raw=true",
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/pelo.jpg?raw=true"
    ],
    [
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/kaledo.mp4?raw=true",
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/kaledo.ogv?raw=true",
      "https://github.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/blob/master/example/kaledo.jpg?raw=true"
    ],
    [
      "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/master/example/glacier.mp4",
      "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/master/example/glacier.ogv",
      "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronik-design/react-drive-in/master/example/glacier.jpg"
    ]
  ];

  const onPlaying = function(itemNum) {};
  const onPause = function() {};

  ReactDOM.render(
    <ReactDriveIn
      showPlaylist={playlist}
      onPlaying={onPlaying}
      onPause={onPause}
      loop
      mute
    />,
    $mountNode
  );
```

## What to `show`

The show and showPlaylist properties have many options. See [example/index.html](example/index.html) for an fairly complex set up.

- `show` is for SINGLE ITEMS. You can provide either a string, or a fallback array (e.g., [ "video.mp4", "video.ogv", "video.jpg" ]).
- `showPlaylist` is for MULTIPLE ITEMS. You can provide either an array or strings (e.g., [ "video1.mp4", "video2.mp4" ]) or an array of fallback arrays (e.g., [ [ "video1.mp4", "video1.ogv" ], [ "video2.mp4", "video2.ogv" ])

## Details

The HTML structure of this element looks like:

```html
  <div id="drive-in-wrap">
    <div class="drive-in-media">
      <video> OR <img>
    </div>
  </div>
```

The included CSS sets up some required styles for it to function correctly.

The component falls back to using an image on touch devices, since many will not play video inline. Thus, you might want to specify fallback images either through the `poster` property or in the fallback arrays.

## Formats

The component currently understands and supports, `mp4`, `ogv`, `webm`, `jpg`, `gif`, `png`.
